# Playnite Extensions

This repository hosts all my extensions for the superb open source video game library manager and launcher [Playnite](http://playnite.link/).

If you want to use my extensions, I strongly recommend to install them via the add-ons menu in Playnite or the [official add-on database](https://playnite.link/addons.html) and not use the releases here on github, because they only consist of the add-ons that were changed lately and not all of them every time. 

If you have more ideas for these extensions, feel free to suggest them by opening an issue!

Further information and documentation for my addons can be found [on my website](https://knarzwerk.de/en/playnite-extensions/)

## Wikipedia Metadata

Extension to get metadata from wikipedia. It can fetch name, cover, genres, developer, publisher, features, tags, links, series, platform critic score and description.

[-> Info, help and documentation](https://knarzwerk.de/en/playnite-extensions/wikipedia-metadata/)

## Metadata Utilities

Extension to manage metadata for the games in the playnite library. It adds a new metadata editor to easily edit them, find and merge similar metadata across types, remove unwanted metadata and much more. Age ratings, categories, features, genres, series and tags are supported.

[-> Info, help and documentation](https://knarzwerk.de/en/playnite-extensions/metadata-utilities/)

## Link Utilities

Extension to manage links for the games in the playnite library. With it you can automatically add links to several supported websites, sort, rename and remove unwanted links among many other useful features.

[-> Info, help and documentation](https://knarzwerk.de/en/playnite-extensions/link-utilities/)

## Company Companion

Extension to manage game companies (see Developer and Publisher fields in Playnite). It can assist you in finding and merging similar companies and remove business entity descriptions like Ltd. or Co.

[-> Info, help and documentation](https://knarzwerk.de/en/playnite-extensions/company-companion/)

## Quick Add (deprecated)

Extension to quickly add, remove or toggle categories, features and tags in games through the game context menu instead of going through the edit dialog. The features of this extension are integrated into Metadata Utilities since version 0.7. You can still use Quick Add and I will release bugfixes if necessary, but further development of the features will take place in Metadata Utilities.

- You can configure which will show up in the menu via the addon settings. Per default none are shown.
- An icon left of the values in the menu indicates, if it is already set in all selected games (check mark in a circle), some of the selectec games (check marl withot circle) or in none (cross in circle).
- You can define a custom menu entry path for each value to make it possible to group them.

## KNARZtools

This is my playground for ideas and quick and simple dirty functions. It's tailored to my special playnite needs and won't be really useful for others. Use at your own risk!
