    Changelog:
      - Changed the "Merge Rename" function to work with more than one item selected. That way you can merge and rename a group of items at the same time.
      - Added an option to show or hide the user score sub menu in the game context menu.
      - Removed "Merge Rules" sub menu from the context menu, because it got slow and unwieldy with many rules and I've never really seen it used.
      - Fixed Merge Rename function not changing prefixes of the renamed item.
      - Fixed conditional actions not being executed in the right order. They are now executed sorted by sort number and after that by name.
      - fixed button "Removed unused items" in Metadata Editor. It was tied to the same setting as the remove on startup option. Now it removes unused items of all types.
      - Fixed "ignore hidden" and "remove on startup" checkboxes in the settings being swapped, so the ignore setting triggered removal and vice versa. I switched them back now. Please check your field type settings again!
      - Fixed crash when starting to add a new whitelist item and hitting cancel.
      - Fixed "clear field" action, that caused all conditional actions to fail.
      - Prefixes with an empty name or prefix can't be saved anymore. Fixes github issue 138.

    Changelog:
      - Developers, publishers, regions and platforms can now be edited in Metadata Editor and used in merge rules. Developers and publishers are a bit unwieldy yet, since they are basically the same field in the database.

    Changelog:
      - IMPORTANT! I removed the complete "Add Defaults" functionality. It got replaced by a new condition type "Game is new". That way you can set up the same as a conditional action and it also should finally work for manually added games.
      - Experimental implementation of a custom control to be added to themes, that can replace the typical display for age ratings, categories, features, genres, series and tags. In the prefixes section you can now assign a name and icon for each prefix and then all items with that prefix will be shown in its own box. It's not yet implemented in a publicly available theme, but will be mandatory for future versions of KNARZnite.
      - Fixed a bug that sometimes cause conditions in conditional rules to fail.
      - Fixed left panel in Metadata Editor from cutting off at the bottom. It will now stretch to the bottom bar and have a scrollbar, if the window is too small.
