    Changelog:
      - Developers, publishers, regions and platforms can now be edited in Metadata Editor and used in merge rules. Developers and publishers are a bit unwieldy yet, since they are basically the same field in the database.

      - What fields are visible in the Metadata Editor can now be configured.
      - Removal of unused fields can now be configured per field type. That now also includes developers, publishers, regions and platforms.
      - Whitelist items can now optionally be hidden in Metadata Editor and details view.
      - Added option to import some default tags from Duplicate Hider and Game Media Tools to the whitelist.
      - Added option to add an item to the whitelist in Metadata Editor.

    Changelog:
      - IMPORTANT! I removed the complete "Add Defaults" functionality. It got replaced by a new condition type "Game is new". That way you can set up the same as a conditional action and it also should finally work for manually added games.
      - Experimental implementation of a custom control to be added to themes, that can replace the typical display for age ratings, categories, features, genres, series and tags. In the prefixes section you can now assign a name and icon for each prefix and then all items with that prefix will be shown in its own box. It's not yet implemented in a publicly available theme, but will be mandatory for future versions of KNARZnite.
      - Fixed a bug that sometimes cause conditions in conditional rules to fail.
      - Fixed left panel in Metadata Editor from cutting off at the bottom. It will now stretch to the bottom bar and have a scrollbar, if the window is too small.
